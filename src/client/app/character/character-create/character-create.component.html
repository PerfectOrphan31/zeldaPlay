              Hylians are the most common race of Hyrule. Players who choose to
              play a Hylian will more than likely follow the Goddess Hylia and
              come from a normal background. Most Hylians are soldiers or
              farm/ranch hands, though a mat-select few have been known to be
              chosen in the past for special training from the Sheikah tribe,
              learning the ways of the assassin and the art of stealth.

                  Those who are farm hands are more likely to be hospitable to
                  those who visit their homes and are usually considered
                  friendlier in general. These Hylians, while kind, are also
                  known to be strong, durable, and very headstrong. Hylians of
                  the farm hand background will be skilled in unarmed combat, as
                  herding goats can really be a workout. Along with the unarmed
                  bonus, farm hands are also trained to use swords in the case
                  of being called upon by the militia.

                  The few mat-select Hylians who the Sheikah have deemed worthy
                  of training are very withdrawn and reserved. They seem to
                  always have their eyes out for those who are untrustworthy.
                  These Hylians speak seldom and when they do, it is usually a
                  warning. Those trained by the Sheikah are skilled in stealth
                  combat, meaning they have a bonus when using daggers or
                  swords.

          <h2>Gorons</h2>
          <div class="description">
            <p>
              The Gorons are a very prideful and territorial race. Their
              physical appearance is reminiscent of the boulders that surround
              them, and they have before been compared to large rocks and
              overgrown sentient sweet potatoes. They are the proud guardians of
              The Goron Mines and make their home in the recesses of Death
              Mountain. Gorons are very strong by nature, but they do not grasp
              the concept of their own strength. What the Goron see as a
              congratulatory pat on the back, a grown Hylian will feel as if
              they just lost a bar fight against four men. The Gorons, while of
              great physical stature, unfortunately do not show the same
              strengths in intelligence. Also, while they do normally have a
              grasp on their current state of affairs, most Gorons do not take
              interest in the affairs of other races, unless it affects them
              directly. In times of great distress, the Goron race has been
              known to shut themselves in the mountain, not letting a word out
              about what is going on while the mountain rages on. It is in these
              times that the Gorons' pride shows and it becomes obvious how much
              they distrust outsiders, until they have proven their strength and
              loyalty. In combat, a Goron usually does not use weapons, but
              instead punches their enemies or curls up into a boulder and rolls
              towards them, though if a Goron is to use a weapon, a large hammer
              is normally preferred. In personality, Gorons love to make new
              friends, dance to their music, eat, and generally have a good
              time. They can often be heard calling each other "Bruddah" or
              "Brother" and a strong feeling of camaraderie and an unbreakable
              bond of friendship can often be found amongst them.

              The scaled swimmers of Hyrule. The aquatic humanoids are the most
              graceful of all races, their movements looking choreographed as if
              every decision had been planned out. Next to the Fairies, the Zora
              are the most intelligent race, always acting calmly and thinking
              about their decisions. The Zora never rush fully into an action
              that will effect their race adversely, and will rather discuss
              amongst their leaders what course of action they should take. Most
              of the Zora around Hyrule are of the River variety while Ocean and
              Swamp Zora do exist as well. The River Zora tend to follow the
              ideals of a monarchy while the Ocean Zora are happy with their
              democracy like communities. However, the most unruly of the Zora
              are the Swamp type, seeming to keep closer to an anarchy style of
              living. However, no matter what variety you come across, you can
              almost always find a Zora wielding its spear or "throwing" its
              boomerang like fins towards its enemies.

            <p>
              The all female race of Hyrule. The cut-throat,
              don't-get-in-my-way, headstrong women that rule the desert. These
              women have dark, sunkist skin, sometimes with an olive tint, fiery
              red hair, sharp bird like noses, and amber colored eyes. Their
              city is heavily guarded and watched to ensure no men are allowed
              entry. Every 100 or so years, a lone male Gerudo is born, and is
              trained and raised to be their king. Until this time comes, a
              female is the chief of the tribe and the role of leader is passed
              from mother to daughter as she comes of age. While the tribe
              consists of only women, many adventurers have made fools of
              themselves in attempts to steal Gerudo treasure or to sneak into
              the town; most of the time these adventurers end up running with
              tails between their legs and stories of what seem to be
              nightmares. The Gerudo will acknowledge formidable warriors and
              will often even allow trade amongst them, but only outside of the
              city walls. The weapons of choice for the Gerudo consist of long
              swords, specifically scimitars, and pole arms, specifically
              halberds. These women are known to be in your face at the start of
              combat and their movements almost look like those of a dance. Some
              Gerudo are capable of magic, and when this arises, the magic is
              normally of the lightning persuasion. While most Gerudo do stay
              within the confines of their town and the desert, some go off in
              search of a life mate. If these Gerudo do find a mate, they
              usually end up leaving the Gerudo town, but will end up returning
              in order to trade or visit some of their old friends.

              They are spoken of only in legends about the Royal Family. No one
              really knows when the Sheikah came into existence, only that they
              have been the guardians of the Royal Family, and it is thought
              that they had been given instruction from the Goddess Hylia
              herself. Naturally, the Sheikah are never seen, and when one makes
              an appearance it is a rather great deal. Being masters in all arts
              of stealth and stealth combat, the Sheikah are one of the
              deadliest races, and if an enemy is to see a Sheikah, they know
              their life is about to end. Rumors have it that all Sheikah are
              known to have white hair, red eyes, and tattoos of their clan's
              symbol around one of their eyes. In combat, it is said that the
              Sheikah are deadly quick, throwing daggers within seconds with
              pin-point accuracy, or spearing their enemies with a naginata
              without a second thought. They are cold blooded killers of very
              few words, but when they speak, it would be wise to listen to what
              they have to say.

              The feathered flying race. These bird-like humanoids are known to

              problem that trouble the world below. They are a prideful and

              the army and the skills of passed heroes of Hyrule. The Rito do
              not take after one species, but all species of birds of prey;
              spanning from looking like eagles, to owls, kites, to falcons.
              Most of the time, the Rito do not trouble themselves with the
              concern of others, as if there is a problem on the ground they can
              just ignore it and stay in the skies. In battle, a Rito will
              almost always be on the back lines, firing arrows from a distance
              and raining death on their enemies. Outside of combat, the Rito
              are a peaceful race that will get along with others, but would
              rather be left alone to their on devices.

              The unknown race of Hyrule. These shadow dwellers live in a realm
              dimension than every other race of Hyrule. The Twili are beings of
              old who longed for a cursed power, and in obtaining that power,
              cursed their entire race to an existence on the brink, neither in
              light nor darkness. What is known of the Twili is that only the
              very powerful are able to create a connection to the natural realm
              of Hyrule by using the Mirror of Twilight. In doing so, they are
              able to traverse between the two realms and make contact with
              Hylians and other races. The few Twili that have been seen have
              pale blue-grey skin, sunset colored hair, and red, orange, or
              yellow eyes. Twili are also known to have shadowy black covering
              that somewhat resemble Hylian clothes. In battle the Twili have
              been noted to dual wield swords, or to summon other creatures of
              twilight to assist them in battle.

              The smallest and second largest creatures of Hyrule. Fairies are
              known to be found all across Hyrule; however, most of the fairies
              found are of the common variety, small glowing orbs of light with
              wings. Humanoid fairies, however, are small chunks of a Great
              Fairy's power that has split off from the Great Fairy herself.
              These fairies are Great Fairies in training, working on growing
              their powers to one day become a Great Fairy themselves. It's hard
              to say what motivates a fairy, as it ranges from a thirst for
              power to defend itself and the ones it loves to wanting to do good
              for the world. The one thing that is for sure is that an
              adventurer can get a general idea of a fairy's motives based on
              its color, as the fairy's aura will likely align with the Great
              Fairy it spawned from. Those resonating a red hue will likely be
              following the path of Din, the Goddess of Power. The fairies that
              glow a vibrant green or gold tend to align to the path of Farore,
              the Goddess of Courage, giving adventurers the strength to move
              forward when times look bleak. Finally, the faries that pulse a
              shade of blue or purple believe in the path of Nayru, the Goddess
              of Love and Wisdom. These fairies are likely to be the healers in
              a group, but that doesn't mean that is all they are limited to.
