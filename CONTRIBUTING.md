# CONTRIBUTING

This project is open source, and as such any help you would like to give is greatly appreciated! Because this application is geared mainly towards being a D20 helper, and specifically a homebrewed D20 system) if there are any design questions please feel free to reach out and ask! I can be contacted by Google Hangouts or email at [jmcdo29@gmail.com](mailto:jmcdo29@gmail.com). You can also send any questions to me on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/zeldaPlay/Lobby).

## Contributions

Start off by making a fork from master and making your contributions in your own repository. After making your changes merge your pull request into the __dev__ branch. Do your best to ensure that all tests are passing before you make any pull requests as well. If there is a failing test, and it is an acceptable failure (a forgetten API token on my part for example) I'll go ahead and merge the PR.

## Suggestions

If you have any suggestions for features, and I'm not responding to any feature requests you can always email me at [jmcdo29@gmail.com](mailto:jmcdo29@gmail.com?subject=ZeldaPlay%20Feature).

Thank you for wanting to contribute to the project! I'm always happy to work with others.
