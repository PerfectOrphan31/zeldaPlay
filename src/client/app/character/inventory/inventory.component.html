<h2>CAUTION!!!</h2>
<h3>Still in development!</h3>
<p>
  This is where each character will be able to view and add items to their
  inventory. Currently I'm thinking that an item will have a "name" a
  description, a quantity, and maybe where it was found if a player wants to
  note that. Still a lot to implement into the character sheets, but we are
  coming closer to a finished product.
